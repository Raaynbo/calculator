1 - MAKE A BASIC LAYOUT IN HTML/CSS
    -> OUTPUT ZONE
    -> DIGITS PAD
    -> RESET ELEMENT, RESET ALL
    -> OPERATOR BUTTON (+-/*=)
    -> CSS ONLY TO POSITION ITEMS

2 - CREATE JS TO INTERACT WITH BUTTON AND GET INPUTS
    -> CREATE 2 STRINGS VARIABLES CALLED RESPECTIVELY firstNumber AND secondNumber EMPTY AT INITIALIZATION
    -> GET THE DIGITS UNTIL AN OPERATOR IS PRESSED
    -> DISPLAY DIGITS IN OUTPUT ZONE 

3 - CREATE FUNCTION IN JS FOR EACH OPERATOR AND AN "OPERATE" FUNC
